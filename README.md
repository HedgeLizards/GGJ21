# Under Your Wing

Global Game Jam 2021 main development

Team HedgeLizards

After a rumbling rockslide, you wake up to complete darkness... When you strike a match to light your lantern, you find yourself trapped in a coal mine. There is no other option than to try to find your way back out. All by yourself... Or not? 'Under Your Wing' is a 2D Platform/Puzzle game set in a dark, but mystical, world. It is a game about perseverance, discovery, and friendship.

The releases show up in [https://github.com/HedgeLizards/GGJ21/releases/](https://github.com/HedgeLizards/GGJ21/releases/).
